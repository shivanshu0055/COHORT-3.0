# Week-5 Assignment: Basic Middlewares ðŸš€ðŸš€

This assignment focuses on implementing basic middlewares in an Express.js application. The middleware handles request logging, including the request method, URL, and timestamp.

### Key Features
- **Middleware**: Logs the HTTP request method, URL, and timestamp.
- **CORS**: Enabled using the `cors` package for cross-origin resource sharing.
- **JSON Parsing**: The server can handle JSON request bodies using `express.json()` middleware.
- **Basic Routes**: Implements basic `GET` and `POST` routes for arithmetic operations.
- **Generally used Routes**: Got to know about generally used routes like express.json().

- Thanks
